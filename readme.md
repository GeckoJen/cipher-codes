# Gecko Encryption Tool

The perfect way to encrypt and decrypt all those secret messages you need to send to your friends!

## Description

I used some cipher generators from a Codecademy tutorial as a basis for this page. 

### Encryption 

The text which is inputted is encrypted in each of the following 3 ways:
1. A caesar cipher (i.e. shifting letters of the alphabet along by a set number)
2. A symbol substituting cipher (e.g. swapping "i" for "!" or "o" for "0")
3. a reverse cipher (i.e. writing each word backwards)

### Decryption

If you copy and paste some previously encrypted text, it will decrypt it following the above steps in reverse to give you back the original text which was inputted.
